# Claude-tips-n-tricks
Helpful info and scripts for Claude

## External

`Dudamel` is my local sqlite MCP that tracks projects issues and specs; has helpful skills for Claude to use.

`xlii` is my app that does stores and restore stuff outside of your repos (prompt-files, skills, settings, etc) in a central place so you can track them with Git.

## Local

* Always use **planning** mode
* Always use **thinking** mode
* Use the **top model**
... you may use more tokens, and more expensive tokens, up front but saves in the long run with better results and fewer iterations.

* Keep your CLAUDE.md files up to date- especially after tough sessions
* Have Claude write skills for you when it needs to perform repeatable tasks
...all this ancillary data times the model prompts for the project and task at hand.

* Run multiple Claude's in separate worktrees or clones for major features/tasks
* Run multiple, deep specification planning sessions
* Do regular, targeted, code reviews
  * performance
  * duplication
  * security
* Install the official Claude Code GitHub App ~ it'll respond to mentions
